        <p>"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
          I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
          It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
          so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the
          midichlorians to create life…</p>

          <p> He had such a knowledge of the dark
          side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
          The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some
          consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he
          was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he
          did. </p>

          <p>Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then
          his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others
          from death, but not himself."
