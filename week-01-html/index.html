    <p> My favorite quote is from on of my favorite anime show Naruto.
        <q>
            <i>Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The
            longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality, only pain,
            suffering, and futility exist.</i></q> - Madara Uchiha</p>
